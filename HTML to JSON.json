Disease pathogenesis, including lessons gained from cell/molecular biology and disease models will be the major focus. Concurrently, the epidemiological/clinical features of each disease, current treatments, challenges and future treatment prospects, including clinical trials will be covered highlighting the importance of an evidence-based approach to health care. This will discuss the complexities behind treatment based decision making by reviewing the evidence- base and understanding the criteria for deciding on what is best evidence. This unit will consider the biomedical basis and epidemiology in the context of the Australian health care system, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), health policy and service delivery systems, putting illness and health in the context of social, cultural and behavioural systems.",

We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

The unit will explore both the aesthetic distance between Early Modern writing and the present - what does it mean, for example, to characterize a text as Baroque, or Mannerist, or Gothic, and how appropriate are such terms? - and the thematic concerns of the period itself: its anxious questions about the nature and limits of the human, for example, that were opened up by the breakdown of medieval theological certainty and the rise of science.  Such questions will be posed in terms of the political and ideological context of the time: broadly, the gradual but alarming transformation of a static feudal hierarchy into the fluid social order of capitalism, and the challenges posed by (some) women to the limiting assumptions of institutionalized patriarchy.",

This unit explores the rise of writing about music, and the many personalities who have long aspired to be the arbiters of taste, the keepers of standards and, in some instances, even the philosophers of their craft. Such writers have plied their trade in newspapers, journals, books, and, more recently, social media including Facebook and Twitter. By investigating key debates that have often sparked controversy and notoriety, the unit examines the role and function of music critics, broadcasters, journalists, philosophers, academics, magazine writers and bloggers, considering the agency that such individuals have exerted in the media past and present. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop key writing skills and produce work in print and digital forms.",

Galang is a site of pilgrimage for survivors and the only former refugee camp to have been preserved. A series of lectures and seminars will introduce students to the experiences of Vietnamese refugees, and students will be able to reflect on the refugees' journeys, their resettlement experiences in Australia, and the nature of remembrance.",

Students integrate this knowledge into OT and related theories/models of practice. They develop clinical questions, and acquire knowledge and skills from the process of describing and evaluating occupational performance, and critiquing assessment tools for evaluating occupational engagement/performance. Students will explore different practice contexts in which participation in occupation takes place. Case scenarios will be used throughout and students will undertake practice-based learning for 2 days per week throughout the term (135 hours).",

However, the victory of market economics has not removed the state from the realm of economic decision-making. Even the most market-oriented systems exist within political frameworks that enforce contracts, resolve disputes, regulate negative externalities, and provide public goods. Furthermore, capitalism remains intensely controversial. It has created unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but has also suffered from periodic crises, and critics argue that it has exacerbated inequality and damaged the natural environment. In this unit, Monash students learn how to evaluate these competing claims. Students will be introduced to competing models of political economy, learn about key thinkers in the history of economic thought, and gain insight into the intersection between markets and political power.",

The primary focus of this unit is the development of an extended individual project focusing on analysis and development of communication in a current organization.  Further professional writing skills are developed through the documentation of the project (pitches and briefs, bench-marking and final delivery reports, written and oral).   As the expectations of communication in organisations and the modern world are also rapidly evolving, the unit is also designed to further students' conceptual understanding of key issues in professional communication such as multi-modal-literacy, inter-cultural communication, and changing practices of reading, writing and text creation.  This knowledge will complement students' work in other media and professional communication studies as it enables a consistent and thorough approach to media text construction.",

Writers have felt compelled to define Irish identity in response to crises, from the agitation to achieve independence from British rule, and reactions to the exertion of power by the Catholic Church, to the more recent financial collapse, and debate over reproductive rights. Under such pressures, authors innovated in diverse ways. Yeats sought a mystical system of symbols, while Beckett turned to the absurd. Joyce interrogated the possibilities of language, while Mhac an tSaoi articulated the affinity between the artist's struggle with tradition and the challenges faced by women in Irish society. Heaney and Kinsella were among those who both responded to contemporary events explicitly and reached into ancient legend for material to help ascertain what type of narrative might be considered characteristically Irish. Considering this search for identity in literary forms such as poetry, drama, the short story, and the essay - and addressing receptions of this heritage in film, popular song, and graphic novels - the unit explores a century of self-definition in a culture that constitutes a significant area of literary studies, and that has a rich tradition of exchange with Australia.",

The outcomes of the project undertaken will vary depending upon the individual objectives established by the students and teaching staff. The unit provides an opportunity to undertake conceptual designs which will lead to the development of these ideas in the subsequent Design Projects.  Students should be particularly concerned with the development of their personal design philosophy, the way in which it responds to social needs and its visual and social expression as a preliminary to its virtuoso development in the major project. The contemporary discourse in design and related theory is actively discussed and debated, with students encouraged to develop a personal position relative to it. Both the intentions of students and the results of their work are debated in group discussions and critical sessions.

It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises & revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.",

                    "synopsis": "This unit examines the medium and its materiality across a range of visual art practices including: painting, sculpture, installation, photography, video, multi-media, social practices and performance art. It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies. It introduces students to the critical dialogue around the medium and artists' material processes.",

On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of atomic structure, how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry.

Students are tasked to consider a range of issues including popular and punitive approaches to crime, Indigenous politics, and the struggles of access to justice for individuals and groups from non-English speaking backgrounds and those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage. Students will be shown the politicisation of criminal justice and the process through which political leaders use criminal justice issues to enhance their own popularity, electability, or power. Students will unpack political considerations and their effect on crime through the lawmaking process as they influence laws and criminal justice responses that legislatures enact. Further we contrast the politicisation of crime in Australia with our international neighbours.",

Ideologies offer explanations for the problems with the status quo, and advocate a programme for creating a better world. They can exert a powerful hold on their adherents, and clashes between ideologies have resulted in terrible wars. As a result, it is important to understand what different ideologies say. In this module, students will learn to identify and evaluate a variety of ideological traditions. This course will introduce students to the 'classical' political ideologies of liberalism, conservatism and socialism. It will also discuss newer ideological trends, such as feminism, green politics, and religious fundamentalism. This will equip students with the knowledge to understand the undercurrents of democratic politics.",

Students will be introduced to different ways of thinking about social control in Australia and internationally. The unit introduces students to policing as a form of social control and students will examine the role of law, civil rights and culture in the context of police operations. Students examine the historical development of police services and their transformation since 9/11 along with emerging challenges associated with policing transnational threats. The focus then shifts to different forms of crime prevention that have gained popularity in recent decades as a means of addressing the shortcomings of criminal justice institutions in reducing the incidence and prevalence of crime. Students learn about different approaches including situational crime prevention and social crime prevention and consider the advantages and limitations of these in practice.",

These skills and strategies include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to investigate and reconsider the context in which we work and live, as well as potential for innovation.  Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques.

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work.

It introduces students to the study of Chinese culture, focusing on the characteristics of traditional Chinese culture, the interaction between Chinese culture and other cultures, and the uses to which Chinese culture is put in the modern world. The unit will use a range of Chinese-language and English-language material, sourced from mainland China and internationally. The teaching schedule will consist of bi-weekly two-hour workshops in which students will read and view scholarly publications (in English and Chinese) about Chinese culture, combined with weekly two-hour seminars based on in-depth discussion of the lecture material as it applies to the topics assigned for individual projects. Students will read and analyse materials and commentaries relating to traditional and modern Chinese art and literature and the social and political uses of Chinese culture in China and abroad, guided by the arguments, concepts and methods employed in the field of Chinese cultural studies. By introducing students to a wide range of scholarly materials about Chinese culture, this unit aims to strengthen their academic writing skills.",

The unit provides an opportunity to undertake conceptual designs which will lead to the development of these ideas in the subsequent Design Projects.  Students should be particularly concerned with the development of their personal design philosophy, the way in which it responds to social needs and its visual and social expression as a preliminary to its virtuoso development in the major project. The contemporary discourse in design and related theory is actively discussed and debated, with students encouraged to develop a personal position relative to it. Both the intentions of students and the results of their work are debated in group discussions and critical sessions.

However, the victory of market economics has not removed the state from the realm of economic decision-making. Even the most market-oriented systems exist within political frameworks that enforce contracts, resolve disputes, regulate negative externalities, and provide public goods. Furthermore, capitalism remains intensely controversial. It has created unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but has also suffered from periodic crises, and critics argue that it has exacerbated inequality and damaged the natural environment. In this unit, Monash students learn how to evaluate these competing claims. Students will be introduced to competing models of political economy, learn about key thinkers in the history of economic thought, and gain insight into the intersection between markets and political power.",

This unit explores Italian cityscapes through their monuments and art works and their representation in literature and film. It offers a journey through the social spaces of the modern city to the virtual zones of the postmodern city. By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato's remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.",

Yet critical representatives of the discipline argue that anthropologists are ethically bound to defend human rights. This unit will explore the debates within anthropology over human rights. It will explore related notions of conflict, structural violence, peace, law and human rights activism with ethnographic examples from a range of geographic and sociocultural settings. In doing so, this unit will introduce students to key concepts and debates in the anthropology of human rights and provide fresh, rich understandings of local-global frictions and the operation of power.",

These skills and strategies include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to investigate and reconsider the context in which we work and live, as well as potential for innovation.  Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques. The course is delivered partly on-line, with lectures and workshops offering key activities supporting students' learning.",

Violent conflict has been a feature of human society for millennia. Today, we are arguably living in a period unprecedented global peace, but there are still numerous countries and regions that are plagued by ongoing conflicts. These range from civil conflicts in Africa, to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, the \"war on terror\" in the Middle-East, and other low-intensity and unconventional conflicts throughout the world. In addition, the emergence of China as a nascent military superpower, combined with the relative decline of the United States, has raised fears of a 'hegemonic transition': a delicate period that, in previous historical periods, has often been accompanied by intense security competition and war. This course will equip Monash students with the theoretical and practical knowledge to understand these issues, which rank as being among the important problems in politics.",
